Here is a ranking of my top 10 favorite philosophers:
1. Pyrrho
2. Kant
3. Wittgenstein
4. Aristotle
5. Socrates
6. Husserl
7. Nietzsche
8. Deleuze
9. Camus
10. Plato.

This ranking is constructed on the basis of 3 factors, in this order: 1) how integral the philosopher has been to the trajectory of my thinking, 2) how closely my current personal philosophy aligns with them and 3) how cool I find the philosopher's thinking and actions.
