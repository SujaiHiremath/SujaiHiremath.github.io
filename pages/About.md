Hi!

![image info](/assets/img/SujaiHome.jpg)

I'm a senior at Caltech with statistics, data science, and causal analysis in both industry and research settings. I’m looking to develop impactful causal inference techniques and related software. My current interests include probabilistic graphical models, the potential outcomes framework, structural equation modeling, and instrumental variables. I'm open to both research and industry internship opportunities for Summer 2023 and would love to chat, so please don't hesitate to reach out!
 
I TA for a few different math classes at Caltech and am a member of Lloyd House. When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with friends, reading philosophy (especially epistemology and ethics), listening to new genres of music, biking, running, and meeting new people.

I’d like to thank the following people for their mentorship, advice, collaboration, guidance, and influence - they have played a crucial role in shaping me into the mathematician and person I am today:
