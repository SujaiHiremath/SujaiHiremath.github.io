Hi!

![image info](/assets/img/SujaiHome.jpg)

I'm a senior at Caltech with statistics, data science, and causal analysis in both industry and research settings.
 
I TA for a few different math classes at Caltech and am a member of Lloyd House. When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with friends, reading philosophy (especially epistemology and ethics), listening to new genres of music, biking, running, and meeting new people.

Iâ€™d like to thank the following people for their mentorship, advice, collaboration, guidance, and influence - they have all played a crucial role in shaping me into the mathematician and person I am today:

* Professors: __Kostia Zuev__ (Statistics @Caltech), __Christopher Hitchcock__ (Philosophy @Caltech), __Bjarne Schuelke__ (Mathematics @Caltech), __Mason Porter__ (Mathematics @UCLA), __Adam Wierman__ (Computer Science @Caltech), __Franca Hoffmann__ (Mathematics @Caltech).
* Graduate students: __Shunto Kobayashi__ (Economics @Caltech).
* Undergrads: __Rohit Kantipudi__, __Cynthia Chen__, __Kavya Rajagopalan__, __Shwetha Kunnam__, __George Wythes__, __Rafael Santiago__. 
* Industry: __Miguel Alcobendas__ (Yahoo!). 
* Other: __Claire Johnson__ (Flute Teacher).
