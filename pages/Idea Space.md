## <u> Introduction </u>
I define the collection of all possible ideas a human being can have as "Idea Space". I currently dedicate my personal life to exploring as much of Idea Space as I can - this means reading, learning skills, seeking new experiences and regularly changing as a human being. I aim to share my coherent findings here. 

## <u> Philosophy </u>
Philosophy is my favorite sub-section of Idea Space. Its hard to define rigidly, but I think philosophy generally attempts to answer Who?, What?, When?, Where?, Why? in a variety of symbolic and natural human languages. 

In particular, I am highly interested in the sub-branches 'ethics' and 'epistemology', the study of what we ought to do, and what we ought to believe. This focus will be reflected in the content I upload.

### Top 10 Philosophers
Here is a ranking of my top 10 favorite philosophers:
1. Pyrrho
2. Kant
3. Wittgenstein
4. Aristotle
5. Socrates
6. Husserl
7. Nietzsche
8. Deleuze
9. Camus
10. Plato.

This ranking is constructed on the basis of 3 factors, in this order: 1) how integral the philosopher has been to the trajectory of my thinking, 2) how closely my current personal philosophy aligns with them and 3) how cool I find the philosopher.

### The Stormlight Archives
This series very greatly emotionally impacted me. I would like to leave you with a list of my favorite quotes so far:

*“The most important words a man can say are, “I will do better.” These are not the most important words any man can say. I am a man, and they are what I needed to say. The ancient code of the Knights Radiant says “journey before destination.” Some may call it a simple platitude, but it is far more. A journey will have pain and failure. It is not only the steps forward that we must accept. It is the stumbles. The trials. The knowledge that we will fail. That we will hurt those around us. But if we stop, if we accept the person we are when we fall, the journey ends. That failure becomes our destination. To love the journey is to accept no such end. I have found, through painful experience, that the most important step a person can take is always the next one. I’m certain some will feel threatened by this record. Some few may feel liberated. Most will simply feel that it should not exist. I needed to write it anyway.”

*“Yes, I began my journey alone, and I ended it alone. But that does not mean that I walked alone.”

*“Life breaks us, Teft. Then we fill the cracks with something stronger.”

*“Some men, as they age, grow kinder. I am not one of those, for I have seen how the cosmere can mistreat the innocent - and that leaves me disinclined toward kindness. Some men, as they age, grow wiser. I am not one of those, for wisdom and I have always been at cross-purposes, and I have yet to learn the tongue in which she speaks. Some men, as they age, grow more cynical. I, fortunately, am not one of those. If I were, the very air would warp around me, sucking in all emotion, leaving only scorn. Other men...other men, as they age, merely grow stranger. I fear that I am one of those. I am the bones of a foreign species left drying on the plain that was once, long ago, a sea. A curiosity, perhaps a reminder, that all has not always been as it is now.”

*“The question is not whether you will love, hurt, dream, and die. It is what you will love, why you will hurt, when you will dream, and how you will die. This is your choice. You cannot pick the destination, only the path.”

*“If I pretend I did not do those things, it means I cant have grown to be someone else. It cannot be a journey if it does not have a beginning. I will take responsibility for what I have done. If I must fall, I will rise each time to be a better man. You cannot have my pain. This means that you cannot have my shame, my pain, my regret, my anger for having done the wrong thing. I will not blame you.”

*"Sometimes a hypocrite is nothing more than a man in the process of changing."
