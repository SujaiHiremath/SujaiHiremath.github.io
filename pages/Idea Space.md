## Introduction
I define the collection of all possible ideas a human being can have as "Idea Space". I currently dedicate my personal life to exploring as much of Idea Space as I can - this means reading, learning skills, seeking new experiences and regularly changing as a human being. I aim to share my coherent findings here. 

## Philosophy
Philosophy is my favorite sub-section of Idea Space. Its hard to define rigidly, but I think philosophy generally attempts to answer Who?, What?, When?, Where?, Why? in a variety of symbolic and natural human language. 

In particular, I am highly interested in the sub-branches 'ethics' and 'epistemology', the study of what we ought to do, and what we ought to believe. This focus will be reflected in the content I upload.

### Top 10 Philosophers
Here is a ranking of my top 10 favorite philosophers:
1. Pyrrho
2. Kant
3. Wittgenstein
4. Aristotle
5. Socrates
6. Husserl
7. Nietzsche
8. Deleuze
9. Camus
10. Plato.

This ranking is constructed on the basis of 3 factors, in this order: 1) how integral the philosopher has been to the trajectory of my thinking, 2) how closely my current personal philosophy aligns with them and 3) how cool I find the philosopher's thinking and actions.
