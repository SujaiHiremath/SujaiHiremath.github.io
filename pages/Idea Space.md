## <u> Introduction </u>
I define the collection of all possible ideas a human being can have as "Idea Space". I currently spend most of my personal life exploring as much of Idea Space as I can - this means reading, learning skills, seeking new experiences and regularly changing my personality and values. I aim to share my coherent findings here, with each heading/subheading representing a different sector of Idea Space in my mind.

## <u> Philosophy </u>
Philosophy is my favorite sub-section of Idea Space. Its hard to define rigidly, but I think philosophy generally attempts to answer Who?, What?, When?, Where?, Why? in a variety of symbolic and natural human languages. 

In particular, I am highly interested in the sub-branches 'ethics' and 'epistemology', the study of what we ought to do, and how we believe. This focus will be reflected in the content I upload.

### Top 10 Philosophers
Here is a ranking of my top 10 favorite philosophers:
1. Pyrrho
2. Kant
3. Wittgenstein
4. Aristotle
5. Socrates
6. Husserl
7. Nietzsche
8. Deleuze
9. Camus
10. Plato.

This ranking is constructed on the basis of 3 factors, in this order: 1) how integral the philosopher has been to the trajectory of my thinking, 2) how closely my current personal philosophy aligns with them and 3) how cool I find the philosopher.

## <u> Mathematics </u>

### How to Learn Mathematics

The most important part of writing a solution to a math problem is selecting the correct initial direction - if you start heading off in the wrong direction initially, you’re basically screwed. This doesn’t mean there aren’t multiple correct directions - it just means there are infinitely many incorrect directions.
Studying how to solve mathematics problems in a subfield is roughly a 3 step process -
* Memorize the terminology of the subfield - the definitions and properties of mathematical objections, the relevant theorems and axioms, etc. It is incredibly essential to be intimately familiar with the objects of study; however, focusing on this will lead to a binary jump in improvement. It is a prerequisite to being able to comprehend the words on the page, but the gains in this area do not compound. For this reason, it is the least important step.
* Build up a library of initial starting directions that are common in the subfield by analyzing various solutions to practice problems - identifying which problems are amenable to contradiction, which ones involve recasting given objects into slightly different formats to solve, generating new mathematical objects that are related to the objects of interest, etc. There will be initial directions that are general to math as a whole (recasting a statement into a contrapositive that's easier to prove) but also initial directions that are particular to subfields (say, rewriting random variables into integral form for easier manipulation). This is perhaps the most important step in the process because for every new starting direction you can identify, entirely new classes become solvable. 
* Practice solving questions by taking items from the list of general “start directions”, and applying them to the specifics of a problem - the starting directions you identify in step (b) are general, but are implemented slightly differently in each subfield of math, and even each individual problem. For example, in analysis “generating a new mathematical object” in the analysis might look like constructing some kind of related but unique function to aid in calculations, but in group theory, it might look like constructing a new group that's somehow relevant to the problem (say, S_n). This step in second in importance, because it maximizes performance in a subfield of math, so its better than (a) but worse than (b) in terms of gaining overall competence.
Math problems typically have 2 different components - the “trick” and the “calculation.” The trick is the component of the problem that is typically an idiosyncratic implementation of a general starting rule - it's that initial starting direction that you must find in order to have any hope of solving the problem. It's the part of the solution where someone goes “wow I can’t believe someone thought of this.” The calculation component of the problem where you iron out the details of the general approach you’ve taken with the specifics of the problem at hand - this involves ironing out edge cases, selecting the right constants to make mathematical equations work out, etc. The trick is typically the harder part of the problem, although calculation can be incredibly tedious and difficult to parse correctly in larger problems. When learning how to solve math problems, it's typically more useful to focus on getting the trick, and less on the calculations; the latter is easier to pick up later than the former.
Picking the difficulty of math problems is similar to picking which weight to use on the bench at the gym - too light of a weight and you don’t get much stimulus, too heavy of a weight and you will never get any stimulus. It's essential to interact with problems that are somewhat curated to be near your level in terms of difficulty. Specifically, it's incredibly important that the calculation difficulty of a problem is not too high - this distracts from your ability to learn the trick, which is the more generalizable skill.

## <u> Running </u>
Who
* I’ve been a casual runner for about 3 years, and a more serious runner for about 1 year. I started running after a long hiatus in January this year - I started doing only about 1 mile per day at an 8-minute pace, but now I do about 6-10 miles per day at an 8-minute pace. I hope that all the experiential knowledge I have acquired helps anyone who wishes to begin, improve or simply better enjoy running.

What
* The number one, most important idea in running is the concept of weekly mileage - this is the number of miles you run per week. The primary objective of almost any runner interested in any event longer than 100m is to increase their weekly mileage, with the secondary objective of increasing the average pace of the weekly mileage. A lot of people reverse these priorities, attempting at the beginning of their running journey to focus on increasing their speed - I believe this to be a grave mistake.
* The number two, second most important idea in running is the concept of injury prevention - this is directing a ton of effort toward never getting hurt. I cannot emphasize how important it is to aggressively invest into injury prevention strategies and tactics: YOU WILL CERTAINLY GET INJURED WHILE RUNNING IF YOU DON’T PAY ATTENTION TO THIS. Injury prevention falls into 4 major categories: 1) pre-run stretching/warmup, 2) running form, 3) post-run aftercare, and 4) managing your mileage.
  * I recommend calf raises, one leg qaudriceps stretch, touching your toes to activate your hamstrings, bent-knee-forward swings and straight-leg-lateral swings for your hip flexors, and arm swings for your lower body.
  * The most important parts of running form include: striking the ground with the front half of your feet first (avoiding heel-striking), keeping a fairly straight and upright back, and having your arms bent at the elbow and gently swinging as you run.
  * A pair of hard therapy balls and foam rollers is pretty useful for helping relieve any pain by stretching out your feet and legs. I also recommend just generally stretching out your calves, glutes, hamstrings and quadraceps.
  * Increasing mileage too quickly is like putting too much weight on the bar - your body cannot handle large jumps in stress, and this is the number one cause of running injuries. A common rule for mileage is that you should only increase your weekly mileage by UP TO 10%. This works fine for mileages in the 25-50 mi/week zone, but sort of falls apart for the 0-25 mi/week and 50+ mi/week zones. This is because small mileages can benefit from adding mileage more aggressively than 10%, whilst large mileages benefit from adding mileage more conservatively than 10%.
  
When
* I prefer to run in the morning, after drinking coffee/espresso - however, I know that many other runners will run in the evenings, or even late afternoons. There are a few important variables to consider: proximity to meals, caffeine proximity to sleep, and general energy levels. I prefer to train fasted - I’m able to run off the previous night’s dinner + I always feel like throwing up when I run 3-5 hours after a meal. However, some people find that they need to eat at least a light meal to fuel their training, and can handle the food churning around in their stomachs. I also train with coffee - this forces me to train in the mornings because drinking coffee past 12 PM is generally disruptive for sleep. However, some people are more caffeine tolerant, or don’t use caffeine, and perhaps will be able to run later in the day with no issues. Finally, general energy levels are variable between people - I am a morning person, but I acknowledge there is noticeable variation in the chronobiology of different individuals. People should generally strive to run when their energy levels are highest when possible.
Where
* I prefer to run on a track, but sometimes I venture into running on dirt trails. I think most people hate running on a track because they find it boring, but I like the fact that I can turn off my brain and enjoy music or think about whatever topic I’m trying to work through in my life. Dirt trails through nature are also extremely fun though! The one thing I would be careful about is consistently running on sidewalk or the road - the hardness of the concrete may heighten the risk for stress fractures if you end up doing a ton of volume. Additionally, runners need to be extremely careful about avoiding incoming traffic when not running on designated trails - car drivers really will just kill you.

Why
* Running is fun, running keeps you healthy, running builds your legs, running keeps you lean, running lets you eat more food, running gives you time to think - most importantly of all, running trains you to control your mind. Running for distance is a game, a torturous game, where you battle against the temptation to stop throughout the run. The funny thing is, its almost always entirely mental - 99% of the time you stop the run when your mind breaks, not when your body gives in. Thus, the longer you defy the voice in your head, longer you push past your mental limits, the stronger your very will becomes - running trains the mind more than the body, and is thus a potent catalyst for change.

Misc
* Equipment - thin running gloves and a beanie are extremely useful for cold weather. Your hands and ears will almost certainly feel the brunt of the harsh environment first and most. 
* Injury - the most common injury that basically everyone gets is called shin splints - this is a sharp pain in your shin ( the front facing part of your leg in between your ankles and knee) whenever you put pressure on the leg (standing on it). This is almost always caused by increasing the mileage too quickly or just doing excessive mileage - the only short term solution to the pain is just to take 4-10 days off from running and let the micro stress fractures heal. Getting shin splints is a sign that you need to scale back on your intensity and duration of running - take it slow and easy homie.


## <u> Books </u>

### The Stormlight Archives
This series very greatly emotionally impacted me. I would like to leave you with a list of my favorite quotes so far:

*“The most important words a man can say are, “I will do better.” These are not the most important words any man can say. I am a man, and they are what I needed to say. The ancient code of the Knights Radiant says “journey before destination.” Some may call it a simple platitude, but it is far more. A journey will have pain and failure. It is not only the steps forward that we must accept. It is the stumbles. The trials. The knowledge that we will fail. That we will hurt those around us. But if we stop, if we accept the person we are when we fall, the journey ends. That failure becomes our destination. To love the journey is to accept no such end. I have found, through painful experience, that the most important step a person can take is always the next one. I’m certain some will feel threatened by this record. Some few may feel liberated. Most will simply feel that it should not exist. I needed to write it anyway.”

*“Yes, I began my journey alone, and I ended it alone. But that does not mean that I walked alone.”

*“Life breaks us, Teft. Then we fill the cracks with something stronger.”

*“Some men, as they age, grow kinder. I am not one of those, for I have seen how the cosmere can mistreat the innocent - and that leaves me disinclined toward kindness. Some men, as they age, grow wiser. I am not one of those, for wisdom and I have always been at cross-purposes, and I have yet to learn the tongue in which she speaks. Some men, as they age, grow more cynical. I, fortunately, am not one of those. If I were, the very air would warp around me, sucking in all emotion, leaving only scorn. Other men...other men, as they age, merely grow stranger. I fear that I am one of those. I am the bones of a foreign species left drying on the plain that was once, long ago, a sea. A curiosity, perhaps a reminder, that all has not always been as it is now.”

*“The question is not whether you will love, hurt, dream, and die. It is what you will love, why you will hurt, when you will dream, and how you will die. This is your choice. You cannot pick the destination, only the path.”

*“If I pretend I did not do those things, it means I cant have grown to be someone else. It cannot be a journey if it does not have a beginning. I will take responsibility for what I have done. If I must fall, I will rise each time to be a better man. You cannot have my pain. This means that you cannot have my shame, my pain, my regret, my anger for having done the wrong thing. I will not blame you.”

*"Sometimes a hypocrite is nothing more than a man in the process of changing."

*"The most important step a man can take. It’s not the first one, is it? It’s the next one, always the next one."

*"A journey will have pain and failure. It is not only the steps forward that we must accept. It is the stumbles. The trials. The knowledge that we will fail. That we will hurt those around us. But if we stop, if we accept the person we are when we fall, the journey ends. That failure becomes our destination. To love the journey is to accept no such end. I have found, through painful experience, that the most important step a person can take is always the next one."

### The Fall
This book hit very close to home - I'd like to leave you with the start of a few thoughts I had about how I relate to the main character, John-Baptiste Clamence.

I intend to describe how I see myself as a kindred spirit to Jean-Baptiste Clamence, the main character of ‘The Fall’, one of, as Sartre puts it, “the most beautiful and the least understood” of Camus’s books.

Baptiste was a lawyer in Paris who specialized in the defense of the poor and disenfranchised. He conceived of himself as living for others, for achieving much for virtue: in essence, he thought he sought and achieved the good. I feel as if I understand this deeply - I am trying, trying unimaginably hard to realize my potential, to reach higher, to become a god. Sometimes I feel as if I am succeeding, that I am indeed good. Sometimes I feel as if I am above the world, floating in the clouds of justice and serenity - sometimes it feels as if I am the only one who cares about doing what is truly right, what is truly moral, what is truly effective, and most importantly, what is truly justified. We are both mistaken.

Late one night when crossing the Pont Royal, Baptiste comes across a woman dressed in black leaning over the edge of the bridge. He hesitates, thinking the sight strange, but he continues on his way. A few moments later he hears the distinct sound of a body hitting the water, and screaming afterward. Baptiste freezes, deducing immediately what had happened, but does not move, does not even turn. I understand intensely this feeling: to witness injustice, a tragedy, a travesty, an evil, a cry for help, and to respond with nothing. To say nothing, to do nothing, to so unmistakably fail to live up to your ideals, and expectations; to fail so shamefully, with no silver lining in sight, no copium within reach. “I wanted to run and yet didn't move an inch. I was trembling, I believe from cold and shock. I told myself that I had to be quick, and felt an irresistible weakness steal over. I have forgotten what I thought then. Too late, too far.. or something of the sort. I was still listening as I stood motionless. Then, slowly, in the rain, I went away. I told no one.”
