## <u> Introduction </u>
I define the collection of all possible ideas a human being can have as "Idea Space". I currently spend most of my personal life exploring as much of Idea Space as I can - this means reading, learning skills, seeking new experiences and regularly changing my personality and values. I aim to share my coherent findings here, with each heading/subheading representing a different sector of Idea Space in my mind.

## <u> Philosophy </u>
Philosophy is my favorite sub-section of Idea Space. Its hard to define rigidly, but I think philosophy generally attempts to answer Who?, What?, When?, Where?, Why? in a variety of symbolic and natural human languages. 

In particular, I am highly interested in the sub-branches 'ethics' and 'epistemology', the study of what we ought to do, and how we believe. This focus will be reflected in the content I upload.

### Top 10 Philosophers
Here is a ranking of my top 10 favorite philosophers:
1. Pyrrho
2. Kant
3. Wittgenstein
4. Aristotle
5. Socrates
6. Husserl
7. Nietzsche
8. Deleuze
9. Camus
10. Plato.

This ranking is constructed on the basis of 3 factors, in this order: 1) how integral the philosopher has been to the trajectory of my thinking, 2) how closely my current personal philosophy aligns with them and 3) how cool I find the philosopher.

## <u> Running </u>
Who
* I’ve been a casual runner for about 3 years, and a more serious runner for about 1 year. I started running after a long hiatus in January this year - I started doing only about 1 mile per day at an 8-minute pace, but now I do about 6-10 miles per day at an 8-minute pace. I hope that all the experiential knowledge I have acquired helps anyone who wishes to begin, improve or simply better enjoy running.

What
* The number one, most important idea in running is the concept of weekly mileage - this is the number of miles you run per week. The primary objective of almost any runner interested in any event longer than 100m is to increase their weekly mileage, with the secondary objective of increasing the average pace of the weekly mileage. A lot of people reverse these priorities, attempting at the beginning of their running journey to focus on increasing their speed - I believe this to be a grave mistake.
* The number two, second most important idea in running is the concept of injury prevention - this is directing a ton of effort toward never getting hurt. I cannot emphasize how important it is to aggressively invest into injury prevention strategies and tactics: YOU WILL CERTAINLY GET INJURED WHILE RUNNING IF YOU DON’T PAY ATTENTION TO THIS. Injury prevention falls into 4 major categories: 1) pre-run stretching/warmup, 2) running form, 3) post-run aftercare, and 4) managing your mileage.
  * I recommend calf raises, one leg qaudriceps stretch, touching your toes to activate your hamstrings, bent-knee-forward swings and straight-leg-lateral swings for your hip flexors, and arm swings for your lower body.
  * The most important parts of running form include: striking the ground with the front half of your feet first (avoiding heel-striking), keeping a fairly straight and upright back, and having your arms bent at the elbow and gently swinging as you run.
  * A pair of hard therapy balls and foam rollers is pretty useful for helping relieve any pain by stretching out your feet and legs. I also recommend just generally stretching out your calves, glutes, hamstrings and quadraceps.
  * Increasing mileage too quickly is like putting too much weight on the bar - your body cannot handle large jumps in stress, and this is the number one cause of running injuries. A common rule for mileage is that you should only increase your weekly mileage by UP TO 10%. This works fine for mileages in the 25-50 mi/week zone, but sort of falls apart for the 0-25 mi/week and 50+ mi/week zones. This is because small mileages can benefit from adding mileage more aggressively than 10%, whilst large mileages benefit from adding mileage more conservatively than 10%.
  
When
* I prefer to run in the morning, after drinking coffee/espresso - however, I know that many other runners will run in the evenings, or even late afternoons. There are a few important variables to consider: proximity to meals, caffeine proximity to sleep, and general energy levels. I prefer to train fasted - I’m able to run off the previous night’s dinner + I always feel like throwing up when I run 3-5 hours after a meal. However, some people find that they need to eat at least a light meal to fuel their training, and can handle the food churning around in their stomachs. I also train with coffee - this forces me to train in the mornings because drinking coffee past 12 PM is generally disruptive for sleep. However, some people are more caffeine tolerant, or don’t use caffeine, and perhaps will be able to run later in the day with no issues. Finally, general energy levels are variable between people - I am a morning person, but I acknowledge there is noticeable variation in the chronobiology of different individuals. People should generally strive to run when their energy levels are highest when possible.
Where
* I prefer to run on a track, but sometimes I venture into running on dirt trails. I think most people hate running on a track because they find it boring, but I like the fact that I can turn off my brain and enjoy music or think about whatever topic I’m trying to work through in my life. Dirt trails through nature are also extremely fun though! The one thing I would be careful about is consistently running on sidewalk or the road - the hardness of the concrete may heighten the risk for stress fractures if you end up doing a ton of volume. Additionally, runners need to be extremely careful about avoiding incoming traffic when not running on designated trails - car drivers really will just kill you.

Why
* Running is fun, running keeps you healthy, running builds your legs, running keeps you lean, running lets you eat more food, running gives you time to think - most importantly of all, running trains you to control your mind. Running for distance is a game, a torturous game, where you battle against the temptation to stop throughout the run. The funny thing is, its almost always entirely mental - 99% of the time you stop the run when your mind breaks, not when your body gives in. Thus, the longer you defy the voice in your head, longer you push past your mental limits, the stronger your very will becomes - running trains the mind more than the body, and is thus a potent catalyst for change.

Misc
* Equipment - thin running gloves and a beanie are extremely useful for cold weather. Your hands and ears will almost certainly feel the brunt of the harsh environment first and most. 
* Injury - the most common injury that basically everyone gets is called shin splints - this is a sharp pain in your shin ( the front facing part of your leg in between your ankles and knee) whenever you put pressure on the leg (standing on it). This is almost always caused by increasing the mileage too quickly or just doing excessive mileage - the only short term solution to the pain is just to take 4-10 days off from running and let the micro stress fractures heal. Getting shin splints is a sign that you need to scale back on your intensity and duration of running - take it slow and easy homie.


## <u> Books </u>

### The Stormlight Archives
This series very greatly emotionally impacted me. I would like to leave you with a list of my favorite quotes so far:

*“The most important words a man can say are, “I will do better.” These are not the most important words any man can say. I am a man, and they are what I needed to say. The ancient code of the Knights Radiant says “journey before destination.” Some may call it a simple platitude, but it is far more. A journey will have pain and failure. It is not only the steps forward that we must accept. It is the stumbles. The trials. The knowledge that we will fail. That we will hurt those around us. But if we stop, if we accept the person we are when we fall, the journey ends. That failure becomes our destination. To love the journey is to accept no such end. I have found, through painful experience, that the most important step a person can take is always the next one. I’m certain some will feel threatened by this record. Some few may feel liberated. Most will simply feel that it should not exist. I needed to write it anyway.”

*“Yes, I began my journey alone, and I ended it alone. But that does not mean that I walked alone.”

*“Life breaks us, Teft. Then we fill the cracks with something stronger.”

*“Some men, as they age, grow kinder. I am not one of those, for I have seen how the cosmere can mistreat the innocent - and that leaves me disinclined toward kindness. Some men, as they age, grow wiser. I am not one of those, for wisdom and I have always been at cross-purposes, and I have yet to learn the tongue in which she speaks. Some men, as they age, grow more cynical. I, fortunately, am not one of those. If I were, the very air would warp around me, sucking in all emotion, leaving only scorn. Other men...other men, as they age, merely grow stranger. I fear that I am one of those. I am the bones of a foreign species left drying on the plain that was once, long ago, a sea. A curiosity, perhaps a reminder, that all has not always been as it is now.”

*“The question is not whether you will love, hurt, dream, and die. It is what you will love, why you will hurt, when you will dream, and how you will die. This is your choice. You cannot pick the destination, only the path.”

*“If I pretend I did not do those things, it means I cant have grown to be someone else. It cannot be a journey if it does not have a beginning. I will take responsibility for what I have done. If I must fall, I will rise each time to be a better man. You cannot have my pain. This means that you cannot have my shame, my pain, my regret, my anger for having done the wrong thing. I will not blame you.”

*"Sometimes a hypocrite is nothing more than a man in the process of changing."

*"The most important step a man can take. It’s not the first one, is it? It’s the next one, always the next one."

*"A journey will have pain and failure. It is not only the steps forward that we must accept. It is the stumbles. The trials. The knowledge that we will fail. That we will hurt those around us. But if we stop, if we accept the person we are when we fall, the journey ends. That failure becomes our destination. To love the journey is to accept no such end. I have found, through painful experience, that the most important step a person can take is always the next one."
